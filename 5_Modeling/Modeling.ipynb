    "Real world datas come loaded with observational features, but aren't *labeled*. <br>\n",
    "With **unsupervised clustering** it is possible automatically group similar samples based solely on their features. <br>\n",
    "Since the goal of clustering is the grouping of similar records, we have to first define what similarity means. But, without a generalizable way to group the samples, deterministic computers can't cluster your data. <br>\n",
    "What's needed is a *systematic means of measuring the overall similarity between our samples*. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "**Clustering groups samples that are similar within the same cluster.** <br>\n",
    "The more similar the samples belonging to a cluster group are (and conversely, the more dissimilar samples in separate groups), the better the clustering algorithm has performed. <br>\n",
    "Since clustering is an unsupervised algorithm, this similarity metric must be measured automatically and based solely on our data. <br>\n",

    "### K-Means\n",
    "*K-Means define **similarity** iteratively separating our samples into a user-specified number of \"K\" cluster groups of roughly equal variance.*<br>\n",
    "Cluster groups are defined by their geometric cluster center, its **centroid**. <br>\n",
    "*A **cluster** is a set of similar samples, while a **centroid** is just the mean feature-position of all samples assigned to the cluster*. <br>\n",
    "Every sample in our dataset is assigned to the centroid nearest to it, so if we have a sample that is 10 units away from CusterA's centroid, and 100 units away from ClusterB's, the sample is assigned to ClusterA. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "**SciKit-Learn's K-Means implementation only natively supports numeric features types.** <br>\n",
    "##### How K-Means Algorithm works?\n",
    "K-Means starts by placing a user-specified number of \"K\" cluster centers in our feature space. <br>\n",
    "For choosing the first centroid placement is possible use the position of some random samples as the centroids' starting spots. <br>\n",
    "Each cluster then takes ownership of the samples nearest to its centroid, and every sample can only be assigned as single cluster. *'Nearest'* is a value that has to be evaluated and in SciKit-Learn, it is defined as the multivariate, n-dimensional Euclidean distance between the sample and the centroid. After this, the centroid location is updated to be the mean value of all samples assigned to it. The mean value is calculated by feature, so the centroid position ends up being a n-length vector within our feature space. <br>\n",
    "The assignment and update steps repeat until there are no more changes in either, at which point the algorithm has converged. K-Means always converges, and it is very fast at doing so. <br>\n",
    "The technical explanation for what K-Means does is minimizing the within-cluster inertia, or **sum of squared errors** between each sample and its respective centroid. <br>\n",
    "**The initial centroid assignment affects the results.** *Two runs of K-means might produce different outcomes*, but the quality of their cluster assignments are ranked by looking at which run has the smallest overall inertia (sum of squared errors).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "##### When to use K-Means Clustering?\n",
    "K-Means clustering is best suited when we have a good idea of the number of distinct clusters our unlabeled dataset should be segmented into.\n",
    "Generally, the output of K-Means is used in two ways: \n",
    "- **To separate our unlabeled data into K groups;** <br>   \n",
    "- **To find and use the resulting centroids**: an example of this usage can be *a company looking for ideal locations to open a limited number of branches, based on the location of their customers*. <br> Moreover, it is possible to use the centroid to 'compress' our data. By referring to the centroid rather than the data sample, the number of unique values is reduced, which optimizes the execution speed of other algorithms.\n"

    "*By showing the computer examples of what you want it to do, instead of just asking it to tell you something interesting about your data, the computer's responsibility shifts to deriving a set of rules that when applied to raw data, has a decent chance of choosing the answers you've trained it to.* <br>\n",

    "- **.score()**: The ability to score how well our model fit the training data.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "While training our machine with supervised learning, it's important to track how well its performing. <br>\n",
    "Our goal with machine learning is to create a generalizable algorithm that can be applied to data it hasn't seen yet and still do the task we've trained it to do. <br>\n",
    "To make this possible, of course we'll still need to fit our estimator; but when it comes to testing it, that part will have to be done with data the estimator has never seen before. <br>\n",
    "In other words, all of our training transformation and modeling needs to done using just our **training data**, without ever seeing our **testing data**.<br>\n",
    "This will be our way of validating the true accuracy of your model. This is doable by splitting our training data into two portions: <br> \n",

    "### K-Nearest Neighbors Classification\n",
    "K-Neighbors and K-Means are similarly named, so people sometimes get the two confused, but they are actually different. K-Means is an unsupervised clustering algorithm, where **KNeighbors is a supervised classification algorithm**. <br>\n",
    "*If clustering is the process of separating your samples into groups, then __classification would be the process of assigning samples into those groups.__* <br>\n",
    "Given a set of groups, take a set of samples and mark each sample as being a member of a group. Each group being the correct answer, label, or classification of the sample. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "##### How K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm works?\n",
    "K-Nearest Neighbors works by first simply storing all of our training data samples. <br>\n",
    "Then in the future, when we attempt to check the classification of a new, never-before seen sample, it finds the nearest \"K\" number of samples to it from within our training data. <br>\n",
    "**We must have numeric features in order for 'nearest' to be meaningful because SciKit-Learn's K-Nearest Neighbors only supports numeric features.** The distance will be measures as a standard Euclidean. <br>\n",
    "With the nearest neighbors found, K-Neighbors looks at their classes and takes a mode vote to assign a label to the new data point. <br>\n",
    "Further extensions of K-Neighbors can take into account the distance to the samples to weigh their voting power. <br>\n",
    "Each new prediction or classification made, the algorithm has to again find the nearest neighbors to that sample in order to call a vote for it. \n",
    "This process is where a majority of the time is spent, so instead of using brute force to search the training data as if it were stored in a list, tree structures are used instead to optimize the search times.<br>\n",
    "Due to this, *the number of classes in dataset doesn't have a bearing on its execution speed, but only the number of records in your training data set.*\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "A unique feature of supervised classification algorithms are their **decision boundaries**, or more generally, their n-dimensional decision surface. *Whenever performing classification, there exist a threshold or region where if superseded, will result in our sample being assigned that class.* <br>\n",
    "For K-Neighbors, generally **the higher our \"K\" value, the smoother and less jittery our decision surface becomes**. <br>\n",
    "Higher K values also result in your model providing probabilistic information about the ratio of samples per each class. <br>\n",
    "There is a tradeoff though, *as higher K values mean the algorithm is less sensitive to local fluctuations since farther samples are taken into account*. This causes it to only model the overall classification function without much attention to detail, and increases the computational complexity of the classification. <br>\n",

    "### Linear Regression\n",
    "The main difference between classification and regression algorithms is that regression aims to compute a continuous output, but the goal of classification is to predict a discrete, categorical output. Using classification, samples get labeled depending on a decision boundary test that separates our data into a range of space. **With regression, a continuous value output is calculated from a best fit curve function that runs through our data**. <br>\n",
    "In the special case of linear regression, the curve is restricted such that it is linear. <br>\n",
    "*Effectively predicting the future*, known as **extrapolating**, or *identifying a trend in our existing data*, known as **interpolating**, requires there be a statistically significant, linear correlation between our features. Without a decent correlation, linear regression isn't able to benefit to us.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "You may also have heard the phrase, [correlation doesn't imply causation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation). This is an easy trap to fall into when using regression. You can build a linear regression model that fits a relationship between university student's GPA and their first job's\n",
    "annual salary. But simply having a high GPA in doesn't cause someone to have a high paying job, although there is probably some significance between the two.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "##### How does Linear Regression work?\n",
    "Everything that regular linear regression does can be explained with this single figure:\n",
    "<img src=\"linear_regression.jpg\">\n",
    "**y = mx + b** <br>\n",
    "This is the basic equation of linear regression and is the formula for the green line above, however we're going to alter the variable naming convention slightly, just so that it matches the SciKit-Learn documentation: *y = w0 + w1x*. <br>\n",
    "All that we've done so far is change m to w1 , and b to w0 . The w's stand for 'weights coefficients', our currently unknown parameters for calculating y given x. <br>\n",
    "From the diagram it's clear that w0 actually corresponds to the y-intercept or offset between the green line and the x-axis. As for w1, that is the quotient of the change of your dependent variable y and the change of your independent variable x. <br>\n",
    "That's pretty much it! Linear regression is all about computing a scalar feature as a linear combination of weights multiplied by dependent features. <br>\n",
    "SciKit-Learn uses a technique called ordinary least squares to compute the weights coefficients and intercept needed to solve for the best fitting line that goes through your samples. In the figure above, each of the black dots represents one of your features and of course the green line is your least squares, best fitting line. The red lines represent distances between the true, observed values of your sample compared to the least squares line we're hoping to calculate. Stated differently, these distances are the error between the approximate solution and the actual value. <br>\n",
    "Ordinary least squares works by minimizing the *squared sum* of all these red line errors to compute the best fitting line. <br>\n",
    "Once you have the equation, you can use it to calculate an expected value for feature y, given that you have feature x. If the x values you plug into the equation happen to lie within the x-domain boundary of those samples you trained your regression with, then this is called interpolation or even approximation, because you do have the actual observed values of y for the data in that range. When you use the function to calculate a y-value outside the bounds of your training data's x-domain boundary, that is called extrapolation.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "##### When to use Linear Regression?\n",
    "Linear regression is widely used in all disciplines for forecasting upcoming feature values by extrapolating the regression line, and for estimating current feature values by interpolating the regression curve over existing data. <br>\n",
    "It is an extremely wellunderstood and interpretable technique that run very fast, and produces reasonable results as long as you do not extrapolate too far away from your training data.\n",
    "One of the main advantages of linear regression over other machine learning\n",
    "algorithms is that even though it's a supervised learning technique, it doesn't force you to fine tune a bunch of parameters to get it working. You can literally just dump your data into it and let it produce its results.<br>\n",
    "You can use linear regression if your features display a significant correlation. The stronger the feature correlation, it being closer to +1 or -1, the better and more accurate the linear regression model for your data will be. <br>\n",
    "The questions linear regression helps you answer are which independent feature inputs relate to the dependent feature output variable, and the degree of that relationship.<br>\n",
    "Try to understand better the [Linear Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html) with an example:\n",

    "- **Intercept**: the scalar constant offset value; <br>\n",
    "- **Coef**: an array of weights, one per input feature, which will act as a scaling factor. <br><br>\n",
    "From here on out, you should separate your data into a training and testing set before fitting your predictor models, as reflected in the code above. X_train is either a single dimensional array, shaped like [n_samples], where each sample corresponds to the single feature you're fitting. Or alternatively, you can run multiple linear regression models simultaneously on the same dataset by passing in a [n_samples, n_features] array. <br>\n",
    "Your y_train target can also be a single dimensional [n_samples] list of expected values, or it can be an [n_samples, n_targets] array if you are using linear regression to compute more than one feature simultaneously. When doing that, your **.intercept_** will also be an array, one value per target. <br>\n",
    "The LinearRegression class comes with a convenience **.score()** method that returns the **R-squared coefficient**, and the calculation for that is included with the SciKit-Learn API documentation. **This coefficient\n",
    "communicates how much your change in output is explained by your change in input values.** <br>\n",
    "*R-squared is beneficial because unlike the sum of squared distances, it is normalized so that the number of observations sampled does not affect it.* The larger the R score, the better of a fit the model is for your data, 1.0 being the maximum value achievable for a perfect match. <br><br>\n",
    "*One thing to keep in mind is that your R coefficient increases the more features you consider when modeling your linear regression, even if those features don't have a good correlation with your dependent feature's values.* Due to this, be selective about which features you choose to use and select just the subset of the most promising ones, otherwise you might be subject to errant overfitting. <br>\n",
    "Finally, **linear regression works with continuous data, as well as categorical data once numerically encoded.** <br>\n",
    "If you do end up using categorical data and have multiple dummy boolean columns you want to calculate, for example IceCream_Vanilla, IceCream_Chocolate, and IceCream_CookiesNCream, then you should calculate all three of these target regression lines simultaneously. Just increase the number of targets, or your training labels dimension, and then each regression calculation will have its own offset stored in your .intercepts_ array attribute, and the .coeff_ attribute will become an array of arrays, one per target. <br>\n",

Sometimes there simply isn't a linear correlation, and in these cases the regression completely fails. Luckily, it's pretty easy to detect this by looking at the resulting R coe􀃕cient, or by visually plotting your data. <br>\n",

    "### SVM - Support Vector Machine\n",
    "Support vector machines are a set of supervised learning algorithms that you can use for classification, regression and outlier detection purposes. SciKit-Learn has many classes for SVM usage, depending on your purpose. <br>\n",
    "The one we'll be focusing on is Support Vector Classifier. <br>\n",
    "Suppose you were a student at Reti DataLab. One afternoon on sports day, your senior challenges you to use any straight surface to separate a mixed group of biliard balls into even and odd sets. \"No problem,\" you say, while laying a pool-stick between the two sets: <br>\n",
    "<img src=\"board.jpg\"> <br>\n",
    "Each sample in a dataset is just a point n-dimensional space, each dimension corresponding to a feature. Well, each billiard ball is a \"sample\" that has three features: <br>\n",
    "1 - its number; <br>\n",
    "2 - it's X-coordinate on the pool table; <br>\n",
    "3 - it's Y-coordinate on the pool table. <br>\n",
    "Stated in data-analysis lingo, you've just created a classifier that can correctly identify samples based on their features. <br>\n",
    "Well done! Having impressed your senior, he decides to challenge you\n",
    "further by adding more balls onto the table: <br>\n",
    "<img src=\"board2.jpg\"> <br>\n",
    "Your initial pool-stick placement still works for the most part, but there is probably a better spot to place it that might produce even better separation between the two sets.\n",
    "This is still, no issue for you. You simply adjust the placement of your stick and voilà, it once again works perfectly: <br>\n",
    "<img src=\"board3.jpg\"> <br>\n",
    "Having moved the stick to a new position, something dawns on you. Where all the balls are on the table doesn't really matter. In fact, even if you had no idea where the 2-ball, the 7-ball, the 10-ball, and the 1-ball, etc. were placed, it wouldn't really make much of a difference in how you placed the stick. The only balls that you really need to be aware of when doing stick-placement, are those balls of either class that are closest to one\n",
    "another.<br>\n",
    "Support vector classifier behaves just like your stick placement. The two things it wishes to fulfill, in order of priority, are first finding a way to separate your data. It does this by looking at the balls from either class that are closest to one another, or in machine learning lingo, the support vectors. The algorithm then ensures it separates your data in the best way possible by orienting the boundary such that the gap, or\n",
    "margin between it and your support vector samples is maximized. <br>\n",
    "**SVC solves the classification problem by finding the equation of the\n",
    "hyperplane (linear surface) which results in the most separation between two classes of samples. This allows you to confidently label your samples in a very fast and efficient way**. <br>\n",
    "Let's say your senior notices how awesome you are at separating even and odd samples so decides to throw you a curve, by placing the remaining two balls at very difficult to separate spots on the table: <br>\n",
    "<img src=\"board4.jpg\"> <br>\n",
    "Your original instructions only were to use _**any straight surface** to separate a mixed group of billiard balls into even and odd sets_. At this point, it doesn't matter how you orient the pool stick: unless you're next to a black hole where space and time get warped out, you'll never be able to get the flat pool-stick, or any linear structure for that matter, to separate between even and odd featured balls now. <br>\n",
    "So how do you handle the situation? The most mature way possible, of course—by flipping the table!<br>\n",
    "A very calculated and coordinated table-flip that sends all of the balls flying into the air: <br>\n",
    "<img src=\"board5.jpg\"> <br>\n",
    "For some seconds all the balls are in the air, you can slide a large, straight, sheet of paper clean right between even and odd balls. <br>\n",
    "Looking at the situation from the side of the table and seeing all the balls floating in the air, a very straight, single, linear-sheet of paper was able to split the two sets of balls, properly fulfilling the objective. This trick of yours is almost called the **kernel trick**, used in SVC and many other mathematical algorithms. <br>\n",
    "*To be able to place the decision boundary between the billiard balls, you had to get them into the air by transforming them from their original three-dimensional featurespace (table position x, table position y, even/odd status) to a higher, 4D space, where the table position z-coordinate was added.* <br>\n",
    "The kernel trick actually uses a nifty geometric shortcut to skip your table-flipping, transformation step, and just jump straight to the answer. The kernel is essentially a **similarity function**. *We give it two samples and it lets you know how similar they are.* <br>\n",
    "This is pretty important because in SVC, your first priority is finding out which samples of opposite class are nearest to one another, so that you can position your decision boundary optimally. What the kernel function essentially tells you is, given your current ball positions, how far apart would the balls have been, had you flipped the table. <br>\n",
    "This saves you the trouble of cleaning up the balls, and the embarrassment of (possibly) not having the strength to flip the table. <br>\n",
    "There are [many types of kernels](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#svm-kernels) out there, and with SciKit-Learn, you can even define your own. Knowing what type of kernel to use, and under what circumstances to use it, are things that you'll have to discern as a domain expert in the field you are researching. A kernel that performs amazingly for one problem might fail entirely with a different problem. <br>\n",
    "##### When to use SVC? \n",
    "**SVC is a classifier, so we could use it on any classification problem**.<br>\n",
    "Other algorithms like K-Neighbors are instantaneous with training, but require you traverse a complicated tree structure for each sample you want to classify. That can become a bottle-neck in realtime applications like self driving cars that need to rapidly be able to  tell the difference between a plastic bag and a large rock. <br>\n",
    "_One of the advantages of SVC is that once you've done the hard work of finding the hyperplane and its supporting vectors, the real job of classifying your samples is as simple as answering what side of the line is the point on? **This makes SVC a classifier of choice for problems where classfication speed is more critical than training speed**_. <br>\n",
    "SVC is extremely effective, even in high dimensional spaces. <br>\n",
    "_With SVC, most of your dataset actually doesn't even matter. The only important samples are those closest to the decision boundary, called the **support vectors**_. _Those samples determine the position of the separating hyperplane and the size of its margin._ <br>\n",
    "If you have a very large dataset consisting of many samples and want to speed it up simply by throwing away samples, a way to do so without sacrificing your classification accuracy too much would be by using SVC. <br>\n",
    "_There may be cases where number your dataset has more features than the number of samples. Not all machine learning algorithms will be able to work with that, however such datasets aren't an issue for SVC._ <br>\n",
    "In fact, at least conceptually, if you use the kernel trick then at some point your data will almost assuredly be at a higher dimensionality than the number of features, depending on which kernel you use. <br>\n",
    "Lastly, **SVC is non-probabilistic, that means the resulting classification is calculated based off of the geometry of the dataset**."

    "Before to create an SVC classifier, take a look at the main parameters of SVC. <br>\n",
    "Of the many configurable parameters for SciKit-Learn's svm.SVC class, the most important three in order are:\n",
    "- **kernel**: Defines the type of kernel used with your classifier. The default is the radial basis function *rbf*, the most popular kernel used with support vector machines generally. SciKit-Learn also supports *linear, poly, sigmoid, and precomputed kernels*. You can also specify a user defined function to pre-compute the kernel matrix from your sample's feature space, which should be shaped [n_samples, n_samples].<br>\n",
    "- **C**: This is the penalty parameter for the error term. *Do you want your SVC to never miss a single classification? Or is having a more generalized solution important to you?* **The lower your C value, the smoother and more generalized your decision boundary is going to be. But if you have a large C value, the classifier will attempt to do whatever is in its power to squiggle and wiggle between each sample to correctly classify it.** <br>\n",
    "- **gamma**: This parameter's value is inversely proportional to the extent a single training sample's influence extends. **Large gamma values result in each training sample having localized effects only. Smaller values result in each sample affecting a larger area**. *The gamma values dictate how pronounced your decision boundary is by varying the influence of your support vector samples.* <br>\n",
    "- **random_state**: _SVC and support vector machines are theoretically a **deterministic algorithm**, meaning if you re-run it against the same input, it should produce identical output each time_. However SKLearn's SVC via libsvc implementation randomly shuffles your data during its probability estimation step. So to truly get deterministic execution, set a state seed."

    "- One of SVC's strong points is that even if we have fewer samples than dimensions, so long as the samples you do have are close to the decision boundary, there's a good chance your support vector classifier will do just well. <br>\n",
    "Intuitively, those samples that are further away from the decision boundary are more clearly identifiable as belonging to their respective classes.\n",
    "The samples closer to the decision boundary are more vague, and could easily be mistaken as belonging to the wrong class. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- Although SVC can run on a subset of your features, if you get rid of too many, that is, if the dimensionality of your features is much greater than the number of samples, the quality of your decision boundary may still suffer. Again, depending on how far away those samples are from it.<br>\n",

    "- Since SVC is one of SciKit-Learn's highly configurable predictors, it's easy to start overfitting your models if you're not careful. Furthermore, unlike KNeighbors that does all its processing at the point of predicting, SVC does the majority of its heavy lifting at the point of training, so large training sets can result in sluggish training. If the ability to do realtime training and updating of your model is of great concern to you, you might have to consider another algorithm, depending on the size of your dataset."

    "### Decision Trees\n",
    "Decision trees are a supervised, probabilistic, machine learning classifier that are often used as decision support tools. Like any other classifier, they are capable of predicting the label of a sample, and the way they do this is by examining the probabilistic outcomes of your samples' features.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "_Decision trees search for a structured set of rules to help the rapid classification of your dataset._ <br>\n",
    "Decision trees have a few key attributes that make them unique: <br>\n",
    "- The decision tree is structured as a flowchart diagram. It has a single, starting rootnode, and can contain one or more leaf nodes, and internal nodes; <br><br>\n",
    "- Each node of the decision tree represents the test of single feature's value. For example, one node might test the feature named 'age' to see if the user is greater than 18 or not; <br><br>\n",
    "- Each branch of the decision tree connects two nodes, an originating node, and a destination node. A branch represents an outcome of the test of the branch's originating node. In the case of the age > 18 test, there are two possible branches: True and False. Each of these two branches would connect the age > 18 node, to two destination nodes. <br><br>\n",
    "- Each leaf node of the decision tree represents a classification. The end goal of the tree is to label your input samples, so each leaf fulfills that goal. <br><br>\n",
    "Decision trees classify your data probabilistically based off of *entropy*, which can be thought of as '*purity*' or information gain. <br>\n",
    "*Each decision tree models sequential consequences based off of their chance of **occurrence**, their resource cost, and their information gain, with the goal of maximizing the overall **purity** of class the samples stored in each leaf node.* "

    "Let's consider the following **EXAMPLE**: <br>\n",
    "A teacher feels that there must be some relationship between how healthy his students eat, how many hours they spend studying, and their final grades.<br>\n",
    "To discern the correlation, he asks 75 of his students how many hours a\n",
    "week they spend studying. It seems reasonable to start with this question, as it should have the most impact on their grades. <br>\n",
    "<img src='histogram.jpg'> <br>\n",
    "Fascinating! The teacher notices that 100% of the failing students spend less than 2.5 hours per week studying. Perhaps equally interesting is that of the students passing the course, some of them study a lot, yet others study just at the average level. To properly classify these students, more data is certainly needed. Being curious, the teacher asks the students another question: how health conscious are they with regards to their food, on a scale from 1-5. Would they prefer pepperoni pizza (1) or reach an apple (5)? <br>\n",
    "<img src=\"decision_tree.jpg\"> <br>\n",
    "Various answers come back, and something catches the teacher's eye. With only a single exception, every single students who doesn't take their health and eating habits seriously, by responding with less than 3.3 on the 5-scale survey, has lower ranking grades. <br>\n",
    "Just as the teacher keeps asking questions to find out more details about his students so he can properly classify them, so to do decision trees like cleanly chopping away at your feature space to purify the class of your samples, based off of linear or straight decision boundaries. <br>\n",
    "This is what a decision tree would look like for the above example:\n",
    "<img src=\"decision_tree_1.jpg\"> <br>\n",
    "The root node starts with all samples, intermezzo. Value = [25, 25, 25] represents all the teacher's students who belong to three classes: slackers, status-quo, and overachievers, in that order. <br>\n",
    "At the first node, there is a high level of impurity. <br>\n",
    "The feature being considered by the root node is the number of hours spent studying per week, and decision being made is <= 2.45 or greater. <br>\n",
    "In this tree, each left branch is a true response to the decision question, and each right branch is a false response. <br>\n",
    "Those students that spend <= 2.45 hours per week all belong to the the first class, value = [25, 0, 0] and so that branch has an impurity of 0.0. <br>\n",
    "Students that spend more than 2.45 hours per week studying consists of the rest of the student body. Exactly half of the students belong to one class, and exactly half belong to another class. <br>\n",
    "In other words, this branch is as throughly mixed up as a binary classification can possible be. This is why impurity is set at 100% here. But by testing the health awareness feature, the teacher is able to considerably purify the resulting selections, such that only a single student sample is incorrectly classified on either side. <br>\n",
    "##### When to use Decision Trees? \n",
    "- With decision trees, you can divide up your feature set into sections and boxes, which otherwise would not have been possible using a single, linear classifier. Due to this, **decision trees are indifferent to feature scaling**, unlike KNeighbors or PCA.<br>\n",
    "- **Decision trees are a good tool to use when you want backing evidence to support a decision, or even while trying to convince someone of a view-point**. By mapping the various probabilities of outcomes, and their consequences, using a decision tree helps you paint the entire picture of the classification results of your features.\n"

    "### Random Forest\n",
    "If not carefully pruned, decision trees will deep-learn irregular patterns and data outliers. They do this so well that they rapidly overfit the training set, resulting in excellent training data recall... but poor predictive abilities.<br>\n",
    "_This is exactly the problem random forests aim to solve_. <br>\n",
    "A single decision tree, tasked to learn a dataset might not be able to perform well due to the outliers, and the breadth and depth complexity of the data. <br> \n",
    "So instead of relying on a single tree, **random forests rely on a forest of cleverly grown decision trees**. _Each tree within the forest is allowed to become highly specialized in a specific area, but still retains some general knowledge about most areas._ <br>\n",
    "When a random forest classiffier, it is actually each tree in the forest working together to cast votes on what label they think a specific sample should be assigned. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Random forests make use of two techniques when training: <br>\n",
    "1) One occurs at the forest level. <br>\n",
    "2) the other at the individual tree level. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "First, like any supervised classifier, you'll pass in a training set of samples along with \"truth\" labels when you create an instance of the class. <br> Instead of sharing the entire dataset with each decision tree, the forest performs an operation which is essential a train / test split of the training data. Each decision tree in the forest randomly samples from the overall training data set. <br>\n",
    "Through doing so, each tree exist in an independent subspace and the variation between trees is controlled. This technique is known as **tree bagging**, or **bootstrap aggregating**. <br>\n",
    "Tree bagging increases the accuracy of decision trees because while an individual decision tree might become hypersensitive to outliers and localized features, once all the results are averaged, the fringe results get blurred out. <br>\n",
    "Therefore using random forests over a single tree decrease the variance of your classification results, without increasing the bias the way KNeighbor does when K is set too high. This technique only works if the individual trees are not correlated. If they were all trained on the same training set, they would only reinforce eache other's decision. The bootstrapping or randomization of samples each tree is trained upon take care of that. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Random forests also use one more trick. In addition to the tree bagging of training samples at the forest level, _each individual decision tree further '**feature bags**' at each node-branch split._ <br>\n",
    "This is helpful because some datasets contain a feature that is very correlated to the target (the 'y'-label). By selecting a random sampling of features every split, if such a feature were to exist, it wouldn't show up on as many branches of the tree and there would be more diversity of the features examined. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "After fitting the forest, a prediction can be made for unseen samples by using the majority vote label assigned from each tree. SciKit-Learn gives you access to an array containing each of the trained trees in the forest, in case you'd like to inspect them individually. SciKit-Learn also supports doing regression with decision trees and random forests.<br>\n",
    "In these cases, the output needs to be a continuous variable, and is calculated as the average result of each tree. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Since each tree within the forest is only trained using a subset of the overall training set, the forest ensemble has the ability to error test itself. It does this by scoring each tree's predictions against that tree's out-of-bag samples. A tree's out of bag samples are those forest training samples that were withheld from a specific tree during training. <br>\n",
    "There's nothing unique about splitting your data between training and testing sets except that you have an independent set of unseen samples to validate the accuracy of your training. <br>\n",
    "Part of the random forest algorithm is the creation of independent sets for the training of each tree, so an overall out-of-bag error metric can be calculated for the forest ensemble. This error value is defined as the mean prediction error for each training samples using only those trees that didn't have the sample in their bootstrap. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "One of the advantages of using the out of bag error is it eliminates the need for you to split your data into a training / testing before feeding it into the forest model, since that's part of the forest algorithm.<br> However using the out-of-bag error metric often underestimates the actual performance improvement, and the optimal number of training iterations. Due to this, SciKit-Learn recommends maintain separate training and testing sets."
